/*! \mainpage Introduction to the ARL KMCThinFilm library

    The ARL KMCThinFilm library is designed to assist researchers in
    creating kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of thin film growth
    where the particles involved in the growth (which may be atoms,
    molecules, or some sort of coarse-grained &ldquo;effective&rdquo;
    particle) are assumed to be restricted to be on or near the sites
    of a lattice. What the library contains:

    - A \ref lattice_overview "general lattice class" that
      represents the lattice as a three-dimensional array of
      cells&mdash;but not necessarily in a cubic or orthogonal
      arrangement&mdash;where each cell contains an array of integers
      and/or floating-point numbers that may be used for a variety of
      purposes, such as whether a site within a cell is occupied, or
      the coordinates of an atom near a lattice site (for models where
      atoms may be on a distorted lattice).

    - \link KMCThinFilm::SolverId Solvers\endlink that select and
      execute events at each time step of a simulation.
    
    - Hooks to add possible events, such as \link
      KMCThinFilm::Simulation::addOverLatticeEvent deposition\endlink,
      \link KMCThinFilm::Simulation::addCellCenteredEventGroup diffusion,
      or a reaction\endlink, in accordance with an implementation of a
      desired physical model.

    - Hooks to add actions that run \link
      KMCThinFilm::Simulation::addTimePeriodicAction every <EM>t</EM>
      seconds of simulation time\endlink or \link
      KMCThinFilm::Simulation::addStepPeriodicAction every <EM>N</EM>
      time steps\endlink. These actions may simply dump the state
      of the lattice at various points during a simulation, or to
      alter it.

    - A \link KMCThinFilm::RandNumGen virtual class interface for
      random number generators\endlink, to allow generators not
      included with the ARL KMCThinFilm library to be used.
    
    - \ref kmc_par_alg "Implementation of an approximate parallel kMC algorithm".

    However, this library does <EM>not</EM> contain details about the
    physics of any particular kMC model. For example, there is no
    assumption that the model must be solid-on-solid, or that the
    lattice be simple cubic. The library also does not require that
    the rates of kMC events be determined via a particular theory,
    e.g. harmonic transition state theory. Aside from the assumptions
    that the model (1) involves sites on a lattice and (2) has
    periodic boundary conditions along the in-plane dimensions, the
    library's framework should be fairly flexible. The downside of
    this flexibility, of course, is the need to write additional code
    to create a complete kMC application. Use of this library, though,
    should still be far simpler than writing an entire kMC application
    from scratch.
