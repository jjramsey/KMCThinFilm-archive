This is a simple example of a simulation with ballistic
deposition.

Instructions for running the example:

- The Makefile requires a working "make.inc" file. To generate this
  file, run the script "mkMakeInc.sh", which will prompt for the
  directories where the KMCThinFilm library and Boost are installed,
  as well as some other things. (Alternatively, run "mkMakeInc.sh"
  with the "--batch" option, which will generate a skeleton "make.inc"
  with dummy values that one then edit manually.)

  After this is done, just type "make".

- Change to the "testdir" directory, which should be empty. Run the
  command "../testBallisticDep" to perform the simulation. The
  directory should now be full of files named "snapshot1.3D",
  "snapshot2.3D", etc.

- One can compare the files newly created in "testdir" to the ones in
  "testdir_ref". They should be the same.

  These files (both the ones in "testdir" and "testdir_ref") can also
  be visualized with the aid of VisIt <http://visit.llnl.gov>. In
  VisIt, open up the snapshot*.3D files as a "database".  In the area
  of the VisIt main window entitled "Plots", click on the "Add" button
  and choose Pseudocolor -> value from the drop-down menu. Then click
  the "Draw" button. One can then rotate the plot of atoms in viewing
  window. In the area of the VisIt main window entitled "Time", one
  can choose which snapshot to view by using the slider.

- To clean up after running the test simulation, type "make
  cleanall". This will remove the testBallisticDep binary, the output
  files from the simulation runs, and miscellaneous object files.
