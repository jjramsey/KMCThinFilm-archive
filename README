This is my personal "archive" copy of a library that I wrote,
KMCThinFilm. Unless something happens to the original repo, the
"canonical" URL for it is https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/KMCThinFilm.

Copy of the text of the original README is below.

The ARL KMCThinFilm library is a C++ library for the rapid development
of lattice-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation codes. It can be
used either in serial or in parallel. More details are available from
doc/html/index.html or doc/latex/refman.pdf.

For instructions on compilation and installation, see either
doc/html/compilation.html or the chapter "Compilation and
installation" in doc/latex/refman.pdf.

Note that if need be, a copy of the parallel random number generator
DCMT is in the extra/ directory.
